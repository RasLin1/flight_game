       "You are an agent tasked with capturing monsters that have gotten a bit too wild to be left on their own. \n"
       "The game is played by typing on the keyboard when prompted. \n"
       "Your objective is to capture the monsters on the loose, while minimizing the resources you use. \n"
       "The monsters will move periodically, but to help with this, you can acquire probes to give you clues on how far the monsters are. \n"
       "You can also acquire other items, such as weapons to help you on your journey.\n"
       "Better be prepared after all, the monsters will try to resist capture! \n"
       "However, if you take too long, run out of resources or get taken out, it's game over. \n"
       "Now let's get started by setting your player handle!")
